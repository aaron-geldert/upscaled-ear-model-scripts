*** DATASET SUMMARY
This dataset contains impulse responses of the sound field around a 3D printed model of a right ear, scaled 7 times larger than anthropometry. 
The ear was mounted on a turntable in the large anechoic chamber, Lampio, at the Aalto Acoustics Labs.
7 loudspeakers (Genelec 8030A) were arranged in an arc at angles of [0,15,...90], with a radius 3.2 meters away.
An interleaved exponential sine sweep (15 seconds, from 10 Hz to 24 kHz) was used, and impulse responses were obtained through deconvolution with the inverse test signal. 
4-channel impulse responses were measured at a sample rate of 48 kHz with a Microflown USP-regular probe and MFPA-4 preamplifier, capturing pressure and XYZ particle velocity signals.
The probe was moved along a dense grid of 225 measurement positions in and around the ear model using a robotic mover system.
The measurement grid is defined with 25 mm intervals in the XY plane and 19 mm intervals in the Z axis.

In total, the dataset contains:
168 directions of arrival, 145 of which are unique (24 polar angles x 7 lateral angles)
225 measurement positions
8192 samples x 4 channels per IR

*** COORDINATE SYSTEM:
A right-handed cartesian coordinate system is used.
The axes correspond to:
X+ forward
Y+ up
Z+ right
when taking the perspective of a human with the given right ear.

Angular coordinates are described in a polar-lateral system. 
Polar angles rotate around the Z axis, with 0 degrees = forward, 90 = up, 180 = backward, -90/270 = down. 
Polar angles were measured by rotating the turntable with the ear mounted on it. The loudspeaker and probe orientations were kept constant, so a correcting rotation of the XYZ velocity channels is required during preprocessing.
Lateral angles are found relative to the median plane, where -90 is left, 0 is in the median plane, and 90 is right. 

Loudspeaker 1 is located at 0 degrees lateral, 2 at 15 degrees lateral, etc.
Loudspeaker 7 is located at 90 degrees lateral, making its measurement redundant for all polar angles.

*** DATASET ORGANIZATION:
+ sofa_preprocessed: 225 .sofa format files, corresponding to each measurement point, containing the pressure and velocity responses for all DOAs, preprocessed and ready for use.
+ mat_original: raw .mat format files corresponding to the impulse responses of each measurement position for a given DOA, organized into directories by polar angle, without any preprocessing or rotation applied
+ calibration_ data: measured loudspeaker/room responses and parametrically modeled Microflown probe responses to be used for calibration.
model _data: .mat data structures containing the ear model and measurement positions, units in mm.
